# CV Template

This project provides a simple, responsive HTML and CSS template for creating a professional CV. The design is clean and straightforward, allowing you to present your professional experience, education, skills, and certifications clearly.

## Features

- **Responsive Layout**: The template is designed to be responsive, ensuring it looks great on both desktop and mobile devices.
- **Simple and Clean Design**: The design emphasizes readability and clarity, making it easy to highlight your skills and experience.
- **Customizable Sections**: The template includes sections for Professional Experience, Education, Skills, Certifications, and References. Each section is easy to customize to suit your needs.
- **Border Lines**: The design includes horizontal and vertical border lines, which help to separate different sections of the CV for a more organized appearance.

## Project Structure

The project consists of the following files:

- **index.html**: The main HTML file that contains the structure of the CV.
- **style.css**: The CSS file that styles the CV, including fonts, colors, layout, and borders.
- **dummy_photo.png**: A placeholder image for the profile photo (make sure to replace this with your actual photo).

## How to Use

1. **Clone the Repository:** Download or clone this repository to your local machine.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/cv-template.git

2. **Open `index.html`** in your favorite text editor and replace the placeholder text with your own information:
   - Replace `[Name here]` with your full name.
   - Update the `CV Title`, `Personal Profile`, and other sections with your details.
   - Replace `dummy_photo.png` with your actual profile photo.

3. **Modify the Style:** If you'd like to change the look of the CV (colors, fonts, etc.), edit the `style.css` file. You can adjust the border colors, font styles, and layout as needed.

4. **Preview Your CV:** Open `index.html` in a web browser to see how your CV looks. Make any necessary adjustments to the HTML or CSS to perfect the design.

5. **Deploy:** Once you're happy with the CV, you can print it as a PDF, or host it online as your personal CV website.

**Customization Tips**

- **Profile Photo**: The profile photo should be circular, and you can replace the `dummy_photo.png` with your image.

- **Colors**: The main color used in the template is a dark green (`#3e573e`). You can change this color in the `style.css` file if you prefer a different color scheme.

- **Fonts**: The template uses a basic sans-serif font (Arial). You can change this to any web-safe font or import a Google Font for a more personalized look.
